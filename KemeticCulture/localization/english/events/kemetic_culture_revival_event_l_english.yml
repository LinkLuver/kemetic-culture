kemetic_revival_event.1.desc:0 "Traveling on the banks of the Nile, I often ponder on the history that these ancient lands have seen, and of those who existed here before me. Looking on past the green of the Nile's banks, I now wonder if the deserts may hold some of the secrets that I seek."
kemetic_revival_event.1.a:0 "I wonder what could be hiding out there,"
kemetic_revival_event.1.b:0 "Bah, best not to waste my time."
kemetic_revival_event.2.t:0 "An empty Desert"
kemetic_revival_event.2.desc:0 "I have been wandering through the Egyptian Deserts for days, finding nothing but sand, traders and the occasional oasis, and my folly has brought me nothing but time from my family wasted."
kemetic_revival_event.2.a:0 "And my shoes are filled with sand,"
kemetic_revival_event.3.t:0 "A Grand Discovery"
kemetic_revival_event.3.desc:0 "After days of wandering about in the dry wilderness and deserts close to the Nile, I have eventualy found the enterance to a massive structure. Upon entering I found countless decorated items of furniture, linen wrapped animals along with objects of all sorts, though it is clear that scavangers had been here before me. Heading into a hidden room, I find an ornate golden coffin, surrounded by priceless treasures, and more linen wrapped bodies. The walls are covered in images of strange, animal headed gods, along with many series of cryptic glyphs, perhaps hidding the secrets of this ancient place."
kemetic_revival_event.3.a:0 "These treasures will serve me well!"
kemetic_revival_event.3.b:0 "I wonder if these glyphs can be diciphered?"
kemetic_revival_event.4.t:0 "Cryptic Messages"
kemetic_revival_event.4.desc:0 "Having traced copies of the glyphs from their desert tomb, I have made it my mission to uncover the secrets of these ancient Egyptians. My [court_chaplain.GetCouncilTitle], [court_chaplain.GetFirstName], has been helping me try to dicipher what these glyphs could mean. Are they an undicovered language? A code of dates? Only one thing is sure, that this will take a long time to figure out."
kemetic_revival_event.4.a:0 "This has been a waste of time"
kemetic_revival_event.4.b:0 "Let's keep trying"
kemetic_revival_event.5.t:0 "Undicipherable"
kemetic_revival_event.5.desc:0 "After months of trying, both me and [court_chaplain.GetFirstName] have made little progress. Now that other matters call my attention, I can no longer afford to waste any more time or resouces on this folly."
kemetic_revival_event.5.a:0 "Oh well"
kemetic_revival_event.6.t:0 "A helpful Tounge"
kemetic_revival_event.6.desc:0 "Looking for a missing link to this ancient civilization, my [court_chaplain.GetCouncilTitle] has suggested that there may be links between the ancient inhabitants of these lands, and those who lived here before us, the Copts. In a bid to see if there culture may help me better understand these glyphs, I have painstakingly devoted myself to learning their language. Is it possible that this tounge may be connected to the contents of this ancient script?"
kemetic_revival_event.6.a: "Is this the key?"
kemetic_revival_event.7.t:0 "Eureka!"
kemetic_revival_event.7.desc:0 "We've done it! After comparing texts of these Heiroglyphs with the coptic language (and a helpful text of papyrus, filled with both an easier version of these glyphs, and with a primative form of Greek) we have managed to crack the code of this ancient language! So much information on this ancient civilization has been unlocked, their beliefs, their ways of life, their history, I can understand it all!"
kemetic_revival_event.7.a:0 "What a wonderful language!"
kemetic_revival_event.7.b:0 "What if I adopted these ancient ways as my own?"
